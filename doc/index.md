# The CPP-Core Library

## Introduction
This library is my personal collection of c++ sources which I have used in other projects. 
I have released them as OpenSource to make it possible for others to se it as well.

## Getting started
To work with the library you will need:
- cmake Version 3.10 or higher
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher
- G++ or Clang

Get the library from github. When you have downloaded the source navigate into the source folder and follow these steps:
```
cmake CMakeLists 
cmake --build .
```

## Features
