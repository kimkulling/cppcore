 The CppCore-Library
=====================
My collection of common tools for c++, which I have written the last couple of years 
for myself or libraries I worked on.
Feel free to use them or to show me, what I did wrong. I am also deploying my unit
tests, so doing a proof of my failures are easy :-).

Documentation
-------------
[Documentation - work in progress](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cppcore/)

How to build it:
----------------
At first you have to install CMake on your loal machine. After that start cmake
in the working directory of the CppCore library by typing:
> cmake build/CMakeLists.txt

Depending on your operation system CMake will generate a build environment for your 
special platform in the build directory.

If you are using Visual Studio on windows a solution file will be generated.

If you are using Linux, you can build it with the make-command:
> make -j3

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kimkulling/cppcore.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kimkulling/cppcore)

The library is pretty small and contains at this moment:

Common stuff
------------
 * **Variant**:          Implements a variant to deal with arbitrary data types.
 * **THash**:            A hash function to calculate hash values.

Containers
----------
 * **TStaticArray**:     A static template-based array.
 * **TArray**:           A simple dynamic template-based array list, similar to std::vector. [Examples can be found here](https://github.com/kimkulling/cppcore/blob/master/test/container/TArrayTest.cpp)
 * **TList**:            A double template-based linked list. [Examples can be found here](https://github.com/kimkulling/cppcore/blob/master/test/container/TListTest.cpp) 
 * **TQueue**:           A simple template-based FIFO queue.
 * **THashMap**:         A key-value template-based hash map for easy lookup tables

Memory
------
 * **TStackAllocator**:  A stack-based allocator, first allocation must be released at last ( FiFo-schema ).
 * **TPoolAllocator**:   A pool-based allocator. Not much overhead and really fast. At the moment it is not supported to release single objects.

IO-Filesystem
-------------
 * **FileSystem**:      Common file-system abstractions for platform independent access and info.

Random
------
 * **RandomGenerator**: A wrapper class to get random numbers. Currently supported are 
    * The standard c++ random generator, be careful if you want to reach a good distribution of 
      your random values
    * The Mersenne-Twister randome generator which provides a much better distribution of points

Used in...
----------
 * OSRE ( aka Open-Source-Render-Experience ): https://github.com/kimkulling/osre
